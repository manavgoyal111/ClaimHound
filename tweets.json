        "tweetText": "Hu Shih, the Chinese Indologist and renowned international diplomat said in 1940s that, \"for 2000 years India colonized China without sending a single soldier across.\"\n\nWell, this is quoted a lot without context by Indians. The context he was saying it in is more important. \n\nHis belief was that Indian dharmic culture and Indianization of China has kept it backward in modern age. And China must free itself from it.\n\nSo based on his inputs and what Chairman Mao saw as backward Chinese culture, Mao went for total annihilation in the classic communist way. He called it the \"Cultural revolution.\"\n\nThey burned down libraries, destroyed all traditional texts, killed thousands of teachers and some 35 million more later, and made the Chinese society follow modern communism as defined by the CCP.\n\nFor Deng Xiaoping to do his big developmental reforms and create a large working class in China where anyone will do any job in desperation, Mao's cultural revolution paved the way. \n\nThis led to rapid development of China on a western model. But is this the right way to go about it? Destroying your own culture and killing millions?\n\nNo.\n\nIndia's culture and civilization is being revived right now as we speak to adapt to modern values. It is being transformed slowly but surely. \n\nThis kind of transformation will yeild long term highly beneficial results. \n\nUnlike China, India was oppressed and colonized for a much longer time. But Indians, inspite of all adversities, never gave up their culture to adopt enmasse anything else. \n\nEven Islam which forced itself on Indians worse than what Mao could have done, and for many times longer in length still is in minority after one thousand years, even in 1947 pre-partition.\n\nI am so optimistic about the culture of India that in decades to come it will be the flagbearer for Indian advancement in a very chaotic world which China won't be able to handle. And breakdown unless they quickly adopt back certain Indian cultural values - which the CCP is trying to.\n\nSo a few decades of rapid development and showmanship means nothing for civilizational countries like India and Indians. Young people, like you see in this video, are only carried away by short term illusions. \n\nIn the long term, if we preserve our culture, its diversity, its plurality, and work in unision towards national development, we will come out as one of the top countries and cultures that have stood the test of time to be continually on top of the world directing its sustainable development. \n\nAs we have always been.",

If you live in Thailand and Vietnam, you will have 2x worse air many times of the year and pay 2x more than India all the time, from rentals to food to conveyance. Even Laos is costlier than India to live. \n\nSri Lanka probably is the only place that can be said to offer better bang for the buck than India. The cost of living in Indian metros is some of the cheapest in the world for the standard of living we get. \n\nOf course, that is not an excuse to live with filth & uncleared rubble all over, and bad infra. But I am very optimistic that India will overcome this bad infra and cleanliness problem in the next decade, as it becomes a over 7000$ per capita country.",
