1967259538358473144,"Hu Shih, the Chinese Indologist and renowned international diplomat said in 1940s that, ""for 2000 years India colonized China without sending a single soldier across.""

Well, this is quoted a lot without context by Indians. The context he was saying it in is more important. 

His belief was that Indian dharmic culture and Indianization of China has kept it backward in modern age. And China must free itself from it.

So based on his inputs and what Chairman Mao saw as backward Chinese culture, Mao went for total annihilation in the classic communist way. He called it the ""Cultural revolution.""

They burned down libraries, destroyed all traditional texts, killed thousands of teachers and some 35 million more later, and made the Chinese society follow modern communism as defined by the CCP.

For Deng Xiaoping to do his big developmental reforms and create a large working class in China where anyone will do any job in desperation, Mao's cultural revolution paved the way. 

This led to rapid development of China on a western model. But is this the right way to go about it? Destroying your own culture and killing millions?

No.

India's culture and civilization is being revived right now as we speak to adapt to modern values. It is being transformed slowly but surely. 

This kind of transformation will yeild long term highly beneficial results. 

Unlike China, India was oppressed and colonized for a much longer time. But Indians, inspite of all adversities, never gave up their culture to adopt enmasse anything else. 

Even Islam which forced itself on Indians worse than what Mao could have done, and for many times longer in length still is in minority after one thousand years, even in 1947 pre-partition.

I am so optimistic about the culture of India that in decades to come it will be the flagbearer for Indian advancement in a very chaotic world which China won't be able to handle. And breakdown unless they quickly adopt back certain Indian cultural values - which the CCP is trying to.

So a few decades of rapid development and showmanship means nothing for civilizational countries like India and Indians. Young people, like you see in this video, are only carried away by short term illusions. 

In the long term, if we preserve our culture, its diversity, its plurality, and work in unision towards national development, we will come out as one of the top countries and cultures that have stood the test of time to be continually on top of the world directing its sustainable development.

Each new tech since then has enabled further innovation and development of humans by freeing up more people from mundane work, making them research and innovate more. This is what I believe leads to exponential progress of human civilization.

But first, like Trump says, The CCP must be the last to celebrate ""winning against fascist forces in WW2."" 

The Chinese communists colluded in many ways with the Japanese to weaken China's nationalist Kuomintang who were fighting the brutal Japanese oppression.

While acting like fighting along side the Chinese nationalists, the CCP gave away valuable intel to the Japanese to attack the Kuomintang and weaken it. 

Eventually the CCP did a civil war with Kuomintang to take over China while driving the Kuomintang away to Taiwan.

The above is also a warning for all - never trust the CCP. They will act like partners, use you to fight and gain what they want, then dump you. They are just copy cats of the US imperialists. 

Now for the bigger truth I wanted to tell:

Trump can claim the US shed blood and gave support to the Chinese nationalists (Kuomintang) to fight the Japanese. 

But do you know the biggest contribution to WW2 was from India and it is Indian blood that won the war against the Nazis and Fascists. 

2.5 million Indian soldiers fought for the allied forces. They were instrumental in winning multiple theatres - North Africa, Italy, Middle East, and South East Asia.

In fact, Indian soldiers resisting and giving a very tough time to the Japanese in Burma and beyond helped secure support lines to the Chinese nationalists to help them overcome Japanese forces in China.

However, there’s no ""BharatTV app"" that allows all the 50 million Indian ethnic people to access any regional Television program from India they desire.

I suggest that @MEAIndia work with @MIB_India and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (@TRAI) and push one such ""BharatTV app"" themselves. All Indian broadcasters must be required to sign up for the app by regulation.

A nominal subscription fee should be charged to NRIs and PIOs, which could be used as revenue for the broadcasters based on the time watched. This would be easy to track in IPTV like ""Bharat TV.""

Broadcasters should also be permitted to insert reasonable amount of ads every 30 minutes to increase their revenue.

However, the control of this app and broadcasting should remain with the GoI. The GoI should offer its own ads and programs alongside the content available on the app.

The primary objective of this initiative should be for India to reach out to NRIs and PIOs through entertainment. India has the potential to reach approximately 50 million NRIs and provide them with excellent entertainment content from India.

In lieu of multiple subscriptions and complex IPTV apps, this ""BharatTV App"" can keep NRIs and PIOs informed about India through GoI news, programs, and advertisements while giving them valuable entertainment.

By now, most online and informed Indians are aware of how Trump and his admin make up fake news stories and claims regarding India. 

Still, it is very important for the GoI and its MIB to do more in constantly letting all groups of the Indian public feel that Trump, his admin, and US claims can't be taken seriously.

This is important because they will soon start claiming that Modi govt folded, made concessions, did deals to give fake ammo to the opposition and harass PM Modi and attack his govt.

For example, now is the time to amplify anti-Islamic statements of Trump and his admin officials in India to make all Indian muslims develop a renewed distaste for Trump and his admin.

Now is also the time to propogate to the left in India about all the opposition points of the US left against Trump admin and his policies for a long time now.

The idea is that, not just the current Govt's base need to be made to dismiss any claims of Trump and his admin as baseless, but also the base of the opposition must be made to despise Trump and his admin.

I can't stress enough how important a strategy this is, and I know in India such startegies are not used effectively. 

But this is how the DS influences large groups of people by programming all sides. Nowadays, it is reflected in strategies of those in India who work and train with Soros orgs, making them more effective.

Such strategies can help the govt stay strong and weaken any advantage to the opposition using such foreign meddling using just information to instigate Indians against the govt. Even their own base will look at them suspiciously if they keep parroting Trump admin statements against India.

Anyway, staying silent is NOT a strategy. For example, if Trump makes claims against India like ""India has agreed to make all tariffs zero"", it is important for the MEA to immediately hold a presser and claim, standing up and sternly:

 ""Such claims about India making tariffs zero for all items are baseless. India has already offered the US, on a reciprocal basis, some reduction in trade tariffs and increased market access in select areas. India is also purchasing US energy for some years now. India will always do what is best for its people and farmers.""

This sort of statement, said constantly, makes sure the public is informed of India's trade offers to the US, its commitment to its people and farmers, and its strategy of buying oil even from the US if it makes sense. 

So nobody can suddenly twist any India - US trade agrrmeent as ""India has given up its interests"", ""Narendar surrender"", ""Modi betrayed our farmers."" Etc. At the least India can do is not give them space for such propaganda staying silent!",https://x.com/aravind/status/1962678704536199435,tweet,Aravind,@aravind,81,22,505,2342,88726,150,2025-09-02 06:17:22,,

But I can tell you that all 1 billion+ Indians, cutting across party lines, do not want this. Those who may want it in India are not patriots but politically misled losers, who only want it to happen to show Modi as weak. 

The current PM of India, in such matters, has enormous public backing unmatched by any democratic leader in the world. Let's not underestimate that. And let the numbers sink in.

If you believe in democracy, then this is the verdict - ""India will not suck up to the US like some other countries."" And  certainly ""India is not running to China."" 

May be you are all reading a lot of NYT, BBC, WaPo, WSJ - all overrun by the red-green cabal who may want India's moves to look like that. 

India knows very well what kind of adversary China is. India has got very smart and calculated in its FP by now. I am so confident that I am encouraging India to make such moves with PM Modi's admin at helm, so sure about they knowing what they are doing. 

China has been making overtures to India for some years now. It wants India on its side. And India has every right to realign for its interests, especially when the US becomes this hostile with brazen threats from its President and top diplomats. 

Every true patriotic Indian supports this. That's again 1 billion of us. IMHO, your posts should be directed at the US if you really think this India-US rift shouldn't happen. 

You and all Indian Americans must be organising a campaign to prevent the US from losing India to China, ask your govt to ""make up"", if you are all so worried. 

Even the Jewish American community is condemning US threats and actions against India. Where is the Indian-American community? I guess sleeping as usual. Or advising India to suck up.

Instead of asking India to suck up, it is time to grow a spine and back the most US friendly Govt in India since Independence if you really care about India-US ties.

1961079152691515884,"I have long been posting about the need for Indian social media platforms to take on American ones, supported by the state.

It is my view that Indians have been programmed and misled to think (in the late 80s and early 90s when US had a free run into our system) that GoI funding, support, and promotion of Indian companies is something wrong and against capitalism.

This is by an American economic thinking forced on us, while they behave differently. 

But soverign powers like the US, China, Russia all have some form of state support, funding, and promotion of key companies in key areas to help themselves remain sovereign.

Digital tech, especially social media and messaging using internet for a billion+ people is one such key area that definitely needs state support overtly (as in the case of China) or covertly (as in the case of the US).

Information and data is like oil, and nuclear. Now AI is becoming one such area. India has long been taking IT, data, SM like they are simple consumer FMCG products. They are not. 

It doesn't matter if some private Indian company develops a social media app, but India must support it and ensure it is at least an alternative to foreign platforms when the need arises. Just like it is some defence tech.

Then India's leverage against such unreasonable tariffs, sanctions, and other forms of coercion can become so much greater. 

In fact, if we already had such platforms, it would be so easy to shut down some foreign platforms if a foreign nation misbehaves and help hundreds of millions of Indians easily crossover to these domestic platforms.

Imagine the power. 

It is still not late. Either India can set up a soverign tech fund to control, or silently support Indian startups to become an alternative to X, Meta, Google, ChatGPT etc. Many countries do this but none is as capable as India in tech. 

Think about this, Koo wasn't doing so bad in terms of numbers. It only got shut down because people were getting their info on X before Koo. And foreign competition, or may be carrots, made them shutdown taking their money.

What if Indian GOI leaders and officials, from the PM to some local agency guy posted on Koo just 10 mins before X? Or only on Koo? The story will be different I think.

And why many are after views and reach. I don't bother about any. I do not even monetize my X as of now.

We are all acting in India's interests. 

We can have different views and debate about them nicely. For example, I am free to think and say ""Trump's new India appointee may wreck ties more going by what's happening."" 

I am free to think and say he may be a deep state plant influencing Trump. You can reject it and claim otherwise, because I am not saying ever what I say is the truth. 
 
And it is not wrong to say Pak and Chinese lobbies are influencing Trump admin against India. I think many Indians will agree. Because that's actually hard truth, we like it or not. They spend millions officially in lobbying. 

Instead of name calling and fighting me, it would be better if we can work together in ensuring foreign adversaries aren't hurting India. 

But attacking me as one - like calling me as US agent when I warn about China's moves or attacking me as ""Toolkit"" when I warn about US moves or naming me ""as spreading fake news"" when I warn about the Deep State plotting against India's democracy is a waste of time and is detrimental to all of us.

I think as Indians we can be much better than this. No need to feel threatened or sidelined if someone else gets more reach or is getting across their point better because more people are aligned with it.

We can always dispute and debate those points. There's no binary logic here. If this, then that. We as Indians are much better at multi-dimensional logic.

And using that we have to understand all the world is against us and our rise. Then give space for all viewpoints to be heard, debated, and the best chosen for the situation India is in.

India's tropics offers a great opportunity for this premium fruit. The Durians need to be eaten soon after harvesting.

The west will tell you Pilates was inspired by cats but won't tell you the Yoga roots and inspiration behind it. It is now completely a western invented thing and no way anyone will agree how Joseph Pilates studied Yoga and even Kalaripayatu in early 1900s.

This is similar to how Box Breathing (Sama Vritti Pranayama), Nasal NO method (Brahmari), Non-Seep Deep Rest (NSDR aka Yoga Nidra) are being appropriated today using western names. 

Dr. @hubermanlab argues that by naming Yoga Nidra as NSDR he is making it easily accessible to the west. 

No, I do not agree. 

It is like naming ""Darwin's theory of evolution"" as ""Janwaron Ki Yuga Vikas"" to make it palatable to Indians speaking Hindi. This is Absurd. This is what China does.

What this does is, over a century, makes the knowledge entirely appropriated and disconnected from its roots like Pilates is now. None will agree in 2100 that ""Box Breathing"" or ""NSDR"" are methods derived from Pranyayama and Yoga. 

In fact, I can see it happen already on Youtube where content creators totally are ignorant about, or don't speak about, the roots of these methods.

It will be claimed in 2100 that Dr. Huberman wasn't knowledgable on Yoga but a scientist and researcher who may have had ""exposure to Yoga"" but he created this NSDR method himself independently. 

Like the way they talk about Joseph Pilates and his Plilates now.

This is wrong in so many levels. It is not just appropriation but also the world losing out on so much other knowledge that goes along side the original methods. 

Like the theory of Doshas, on how certain poses and pranayama can be done only by certain people with a particular imbalance in their doshas, the right methods to do it, etc.

Just because all these aren't considered important or ""scientific"" now and aren't researched well doesn't mean they may not be important. 

Yoga and Pranayama have developed over millenias and there may be so much more science to discover in them than just what ""NSDR"" and ""Box Breathing"" research have discovered. 

For more than two millenia this is how Indian knowledge has been appropriated by the world. And worse Indians ridiculed for asking just some credit. 

This incites more Indians to become defensive and over-claiming, which is then used to deny Indians any credit left.

China will never see India as an equal partner. India will always be viewed as a satellite state to be subjugated and made subservient.

But that's ok. As long as Indians understand this and keep this in mind, India can manage China as it has always been China's guru.

For India - and all Indians know this - an upfront adversary like China is better to have than a sly backstabbing ""partner"" like America.

India knows what China wants - its territory, its market, and a breakup of India into parts before it rises to become a threat to China.

But Indians, at least me, still don’t understand what the US wants from India? I believe the US itself is unclear about what it wants.

The US imagines India as a potential threat to its hegemony, either alone or with Russia and China. However, it also sees India as a weak, poor, incompetent, and easily manipulable democracy.

This confusion is costing the US as it is losing influence over India in both ways it tries. 

Be it acting as a friend, partner and gaining influence OR acting as the “deep state” that meddles in India's democracy, uses Pakistan as a proxy, and does arm-twisting.

Russian oil is still cheaper than other crude baskets India buys by about $6. But accouting for shipping and insurance, the discount is just $2 as of now.

If Russia-Ukraine peace deal happens, even this discount will evaporate for India. So India will naturally cut Russian oil purchases by end of this year. 

And India may also cut it drastically given it makes no sense for India to buy Russian crude at the same rate as Arabian, Iranian, or even American (shale) crude paying more for shipping, insurance, and even refining.

But this drastic cut will be projected as a weakness of India. And using propaganda, the inimical forces will make it look like PM Modi buckled under Trump's tariffs pressure. 

The US itself will do this propaganda to project Trump as some winner and, of course, the already anti-India world media and Pakistani SM operators left unchecked by MIB will amplify this within India.

Opposition, as usual, will use these foreign propaganda to the full extent in India to hit against PM Modi. And sadly the opposition will do, as usual, doing what Pak, China, or US do in disillusioning most Indians about the strength of our country.

Be ready to back the govt and our country then. It is important.

Also, once Russia-Ukraine peace deal is reached, the US has no reasons to keep tariffs so high on India with little benefit to itself.  It will also ease the tariffs but make it look like it did so because India budged and obliged.

India already was ready to allow some US farm products in as it is not a threat to our farming or economy. And India already buys some US energy. So once the US removes the tariffs, a trade deal will also be reached between US and India where there will be some give and take. 

But this will be used to instigate protests in India against the GoI poisioning the minds of Indians. It will be propagated as ""Modi sold India to the US"" or ""Modi is selling India for Adani"". GoI needs to beware and preempt this wit facts and information flow at the earnest. Please don't be quiet and give space to mischief makers to fill it with misinformation. 

Let's start with this post. Let's understand one thing: 

The whole tariffs show by Trump on India now is due to him getting snubbed by India for his fake claims about forcing India-Pak ceasefire. He just wants a win here. Something narrative like ""his tariffs arm twisted India to give up Russian oil"" which he already knows was anyway happening.

So US tariffs may go up now but come down one day later this year if Russia-Ukraine peace deal is reached. There will be a positive sentiment boost for the Indian economy then and  stock markets may boom soon after for sometime.

Also, some humble suggestions for our MEA - give Trump the win and Nobel Prize he wants using a good strategy.

When Russia-Ukraine peace deal happens, or as it is happening, use the SM, including his Truth Social to keep encouraging and congratulating Trump for the peace talks and progress. 

Be proactive in this. Ensure Trump is personally congratulated from high levels of GoI, and show that India supports him for the Nobel Peace prize (I actually think he deserves the silly prize he's after, if Syria war lord Obama can be given one!)

Also, I believe he will be given the Nobel Peace Prize one day for sure because many countries are pragmatic and know it will get them a lot of good with the US. So no point for India acting like it doesn't like him getting a Nobel.

This costs nothing for India and will quickly reset ties which is important because Pakistan has clearly and substantially infiltrated the US admin under Trump now, and this is definitely not good for India in the short or long term.

China had a lot of dangerous wild animals too. Tigers, Elephants, Leopards, and Wolves. All killed by humans. 

In India and Africa they thrive only because of humans learning to live with them. But even in Africa, the westerners go game hunting and kill them to this day. They fuel strife and war, leading to animal trade. China fuels animal smuggling and killing for its TCM. 

But later India gets preached about ""protecting its animals."" Foolish Indian sepoys, colonized in their minds, parrot these same lines by foreigners, who have long destroyed their fauna, say. 

In some western countries, they shoot dead sharks for attacking humans after these humans enter their sea, which is not even our natural habitat, for fun and games.

Since the British left, India's dangerous and wild animal population has only increased. For thousands of years, Indians have found a way to live with dangerous wild animals. 

That's why we still have such diversity in fauna. And all Indianized states surrounding us do from Sri Lanka to Bhutan to Thailand and Vietnam. 

You can go find out how Tigers suddenly dropped in population to endangered numbers in Indonesia and Malaysia after they Islamized. Or Elephants and Tigers almost vanished in Laos and Vietnam after they became communist. 

All were Indianized before and harboured a large number of these wild animals. In fact, Laos means a land of a million elephants. Not much left now compared to their still Indianized neighbor, the Buddhist and democratic, Thailand. 

In modern day India too, we have demarcated their spaces and have let them grow in population.

Any human-animal conflict in India is made immediately into how Indians have encroached their spaces and making their lives very difficult.

Nothing can be further from the truth. Indians tolerate a lot to let one Tiger live, which naturally expand seeking territory, even losing their loved ones. Elephants regularly go rouge and stray out killing people in their villages outside sanctuaries.

Similarly, other countries do not have a stray dog problem because they catch and killed these dogs long ago. To this day, I  see some developed countries catch any feral dog immediately and euthanize them. Nobody bats an eye lid.

This message is for mindless Indians colonized by western and foreign narratives on India. Stop hating your country programmed by them.

Perplexity’s offer, backed by significant investors, will weaken Google’s arguments in court. Additionally, Perplexity has the flexibility to withdraw its offer at any time. Oops.

In a case of ragging in China, a 14-year-old girl was brutally bullied, beaten up, and nearly killed by her classmates.

The video went viral quickly enough before the CCP could ban it. The girl’s parents kneeled down, begged, and pleaded with local police and authorities for justice.

However, instead of receiving justice, they were reportedly beaten up themselves. This video too went viral, leading to large-scale protests.

During one of the protests, an elderly man approached the police officers sent to quell the unrest and asked, “Will you beat me too and drag me away?” The police responded by doing exactly that.

They beat him up and dragged him to the police station. The protests were brutally suppressed with an iron fist. The internet was censored for all videos and posts related to this incident.

Many individuals who shared information about the incident have been arrested under various laws as a means of silencing them and sending a message to others not to speak out.

Half of China is unaware of the incident that occurred in Jiangyou, Sichuan, or the protests that took place there. Just like much of the rest of the world.

The other half that is aware is unable to even post about the atrocities online.

Recently, someone suggested that the same treatment should be applied to those in India who fall for Chinese propaganda videos against India and Pakistani India-China comparison psyops.

They argued that this treatment would lead to a reduction in unwanted dissent, the establishment of order, and a much faster growth of India.

It is not idiotic to say that the Indian IT sector has failed India in the age of technology for over three decades by failing to invest the money it has earned in local innovation.

This lack of investment has hindered India’s progress in becoming Atma Nirbhar in so much of tech we use. Unlike in the case of UPI and Aadhar which came with a hard GoI push and investment. 

Btw, both UPI and Aadhar became a huge success in Indian tech innovation for the masses thanks to the GoI and private IT sector working together.

This is one of the reasons I advocate for a government push using a Sovereign Wealth Fund, created by a forced down the throat regulation, from the idle capital of our IT companies to give an impetus to Indian innovation in tech.

It is not idiotic to say that Indian IT companies have exploited Indian labor only for their profit using labor cost arbitrage. But failed to invest that profit for creating India's own tech. 

They will call for 100 hour work weeks from employees. But will never say they will make 1 truly innovative Indian tech product out of 100,000 employees working 100 hours a week to replace a foreign tech used in India by 1 billion.

Their foreign slaving practices have persisted even after they have earned sufficient profits to invest in developing innovative technology products for an attractive market of a billion people created by the GoI with cheap data and internet access.

It is not idiotic to say that Indian IT companies do not invest as much in our startups and researchers as they should. 

Why would they when they can easily make money by hiring cheap tech coders from colleges instead of funding Indian tech researchers at universities who can innovate products for our people?

Just to say my post is “idiotic” to other Indians, it has to be unfortunately on an American-owned platform on American-developed computing and servers, going up to protocol level. 

Even if some technology can be claimed as “Indian,” it will only be considered Indian innovation in name, not in control.

This tech enslavement of India is a reality that will only worsen as technology progresses rapidly in the West in this age of AI. 

It is not idiotic to recognize that India should not become tech slaves of the United States, or soon, China.

The presence of Fortune 500 and foreign companies with R&D centers in India does not negate the fact that they are also utilizing cheap Indian labor to create and own the technology.

This is not different to how Reuters and BBC employ Indian sepoys to attack India, generating and owning anti-India narratives on a daily basis.

If the US wants, it has the power to shut down much of useful internet access in India at will. There would be no platform where I could post my “idiotic” posts.

It is so bad that the Prime Minister cannot reach his hundreds of millions of followers on the internet, as his social media platforms, apps, and website all rely on numerous US services. 

It’s not idiotic to ask why Indian “IT Services” companies aren’t able to provide simple similar services to this day to the PM?

Even the “Dot in” domain is not managed by India. In August 2018, India’s National Internet Exchange appointed Neustar Data Infotech, a subsidiary of Neustar Inc. from the USA, as the country’s new registry services provider.

Should we wait for Trump to order them to block all .in domains for a day or a US company like Cloudflare to block access to half of the websites Indians use for many days?

It is crucial that the GoI takes these companies to task if they behave in this manner.

If Indians see China reaching a trade deal with the US soon - which is surely bound to happen at least in optics. And Trump praising China, even paying a visit to the celestial emperor in Beijing, don't let the propaganda misguide and disillusion you that ""it is a failure of Indian foreign policy.""

As I have said many times before, China was sheilded from western trade imperialism for centuries by a rich India. So civilizationally, they are no match for India in understanding how this western trade plays out over 50-100 years.

India, on the other hand, culturally and inherently knows what this trade imposition with short term benefits means. A form of colonization and breakup sooner or later. You know it.

Even the retail investor in India knows this and doesn't react to such tariff threats. That's why we still don't see any anti-India media reports on Reuters, BBC, NYT, CNA, Nikkei etc on Indian stock markets fearmongering us. Be ready for them when there's even a slight slide. They will come with a full blast.

India has never let western trade dictate its economy. And we must appreciate INC in this over the last 50+ years doing what is culturally ingrained in us as knowledge. 

And we must appreciate the current BJP govt as well for not letting it happen. We have to think and act as Indians in this case where a big power is imposing on us. Or we will falter.

We are a civilizational state that knows much better. It is programmed in our genes. 

That's why China has a huge dependence on western trade for its GDP now while India does not. And Indians are much more capable of taking pain and economic distress than the New-Gen rich Chinese thanking western trade. 

Even a decade of economic issues due to western actions and sanctions will not make India any much weaker. It may cost us some GDO growth and other issues but we have been through this.

India's trade with the US is a fraction of China. But for China, losing this trade means losing continued growth and prosperity for its citizens, or a decline in GDP that can rattle its people to protest and end the govt leading to colonization by western interests.

So, do not fret if you can understand this. 

India will come out well if we stick to our principles and civilizational knowledge in the long term. This is important.

""India is only assembling, there's nothing great about Made in India"". 

Or ""India is only doing 28nm chips, the world is ahead at 3nm.""

This is a letter to those who follow such politicians and parrot their propaganda.

Firstly, know about a ""Made in China"" iPhone in 2025:

Processor: Designed by Apple in the US, but manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan.

Display: Either from Samsung or LG in South Korea.

Camera: Often from Sony in Japan.

Memory Chips: SK Hynix (South Korea) or Micron (US).

Battery: ATL in China or Samsung SDI in South Korea.

Sensors, Connectors, and More: A global mix from suppliers in Germany, Vietnam, Malaysia, and beyond.

Casings: From India or Thailand

China doesn’t make the entire iPhone. No country in today's globalized world can claim to make it all for a product. Even for mission critical defense equipment like fighter jets.

Now, here’s what you need to understand: 

India is already in the game since last decade. But it wasn't for many, many years before and lost out when the game started in 2007. But now it is catching up. 

Support it, if not at least don't mock it.

Foxconn, the same company *assembling* iPhones in China, is doing it in India too. Indian companies are also now supplying components, and we’re climbing the value chain. 

Manufacturing is a like a marathon. China didn’t become the “world’s factory” overnight. It took decades of strategy, investment, and global partnerships. And it had to start somewhere too.

So why do some Indians mock at “Made in India” efforts? Don't do it following good for nothing political leaders. They themselves have done nothing in life.

It’s nothing but sadistic political propaganda or foreign misinformation to disillusion you. They love to paint whatever India does as ""good for nothing.""

But here’s the truth: every manufacturing powerhouse started small. The US, Japan, South Korea, China - all leaned on global supply chains before dominating them.

Don’t Fall for their trap. Use your brain and don't destroy your own mental peace, health and derail your own economy. You are invested in it too. 

It’s easy to get disillusioned by their statements that “India can’t compete” or political propaganda that ""India is only assembling"" after doing nothing for decades to get the country started.

Support the steps: Policies like “Make in India” or PLI schemes aren’t perfect, but they’re steps. Critique them, improve them, but don’t dismiss them.

Celebrate progress: Every iPhone assembled in India, every semiconductor fab planned, is a win. For you and the country.

Skill up: Manufacturing today isn’t just about cheap labor, it’s about skilled workers, innovation, and R&D. Push yourself to take up the required education and training.

The Chinese don’t deride their own progress like losers - they build on it. Nobody in China goes around the world claiming what China is doing is silly assembling and low cost work.

They were doing even poorer work than India when they started.

Indians shouldn’t either. It’s not about blind patriotism; it’s about recognizing that in a globalized world, “Made in India” means becoming a key player in the global supply chain adding as much value as we can.

So, next time someone trashes India’s manufacturing efforts, remind them, even the “Made in China” iPhone isn't even 20% ""made in China.""

It’s a world product. And India is part of that world now - whether they like it or not. Support the journey. Be proud of the progress. Strive for more.",https://x.com/aravind/status/1952373036381839792,tweet,Aravind,@aravind,100,34,1328,5065,184123,610,2025-08-04 19:46:19,,

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is known to infect cardiac cells via ACE2 receptors, causing direct damage. It also promotes arterial inflammation, elevates the risk of blood clots, and increases the likelihood of heart failure.

Based on this, I hypothesize that repeated COVID-19 infections may contribute to cardiac issues in otherwise healthy adults. While some attribute these events to mRNA vaccines, I believe the evidence does not strongly support this after years of observation.

As a precaution, I recommend that young adults who have had COVID-19 undergo at least a treadmill ECG before engaging in intense physical activity. For those over 40, a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation is advisable, including:

- ECG and stress test
- Echocardiogram
- Blood tests for lipid profile and cardiac biomarkers
- Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) test to assess arterial plaque
- CT scan with calcium scoring, if indicated

Aggressively manage elevated lipids and triglycerides, particularly in individuals over 40 (previously recommended for those over 50).

If the US can provide oil at a cheaper rate than Russia, which is highly unlikely, it may buy from the US too. So it is not that India will buy oil only from Russia.

But India is not answerable to the American public or govt. It will do what is in its best interests, while also giving due consideration to the interests of its partners like the US if its other geopolitical interests are supported. 

India is not going to be bullied around for sure.  Because it has seen much worse of what the world can do it, and India still maintains its resilience and resolve to be an independent, soverign nation. 

If the US thinks it will use Pakistan against India now, it has to remember, India as a much poorer and much less capable country was able to fend of US attacks, sanctions, proxy wars on its economy in the decades before. 

Though that cost India its growth and political stablity, it didn't make India dependent on US markets like China to keep up a growth rate. That's why even now threats of tariffs don't make India jittery.

There is no point why the US has to go back to its old methods of using threats, sanctions, Pakistan and other proxy war methods against India for simple trade issues. 

If the US thinks it can topple the current govt and bring another one in its interests. Good luck to it. I can assure you it will only get worse for the US.

Because the next govt may completely align with Russia and China on everything and the US will be left with a pre-NDA, but a $5 trillion dollar economic power, in full trade partnership with China and Russia to deal with.

1949293246389141967,"The US sure can't be trusted. It will rug pull India anytime and has constantly tried to harm Indian interest, by using Pakistan. 

But to think China should be trusted and say ""India must work together with China..."", as if India didn't try before, ""...or we can't be a $10T economy"" is not something I can agree with. 

Indians have to understand these fundamental things about China:

- China is a copy-cat culture. It has been so since 2000 years ago when their people came to India in droves to copy religion, philosophy, knowledge, martial arts, and medicine. Even their language has lifted stuff from Sanskrit and Prakrit in grammatics and tones.

- China is today a wannabe superpower still having the same copy-cat culture in everything. But not from India, which they look down upon now, but from the imperial west which they look up to - From their western names to marriage ceremonies to adopting Christianity in huge numbers, to copying manufacturing, tech, and IP.

Add to this, their other aspect in culture: 

While things like ""looking down on India"" is a recent phenomena programmed by the CCP due to some fears, the Chinese imagining they are the center of the world - an imperial power to which neighboring states must be subservient - is ingrained in them for thousands of years. They always aspire towards being this imperial-center-of-the-world power patronizing others.

Now, I don't care about their culture so much. It is upto them to be copy-cats or have an imperial medieval mindset about their country in the modern age. I don't care about them abolishing Indianized culture and adopting western culture, it is their choice. 

And, in fact, I will go on to say that shaking off Indianized culture has helped them advance so quickly in the last 50 years after the cultural revolution. But it has its inherent strengths when chaos rocks the boat, as it often happens to civilizations.

Remember the Chinese scholar Hu Shih, whom Indians like to quote saying ""India dominated China culturally for 2000 years without sending a single soldier across?"" He said that in a negative way. He said that Indian culture is keeping China backwards and it must be abolished. Which they did.

What I am worried about is the deadly combination of both, that can literally break and subjugate India into satellite states:

Their copy-cat culture extending to using western imperialist geopolitical strategies like debt trapping, trade war, proxy wars, deep state infiltration and influence of democracies, meddling in others systems, capturing and stealing what is not theirs if there is a chance, etc along with the incessant need to dominate the world and keep neighbors subjugated as satellite states is a deadly combination.

Let me again say this, COPYING WESTERN IMPERIALIST METHODS in subjugating countries, especially neighbors like India, by using trade as a bait and Pakistan as an anti-India proxy, (like the British did and the US now does) is something India has to be VERY WARY about. 

I am not suggesting we abolish trade with China. Neither can they with a 1.4 billion population, fastest growing major economy like India. 

But we must not be funding their war and subjugation of us with an expanding trade deficit aiming for some arbitrary, western economic standard of ""$10 trillion GDP"", as if it is some great target of a civilization like ours. We may lose the country in the process.

We should not so easily forget 1962, 2017, 2020, Galwan, and how they back stab every time creating unnecessary conflicts trying to grab land as an expansionist power. The US and China are two sides of the same coin. The US wants virtual control. China aspires for real control.

To say, ""we need to partner and align with China now to take on the US"" seems coming straight from the mouth of the CCP when it suits them.

First, the experience or experiencer is only real. Like your consciousness cooking up a dream where you, all of whom you meet, and the world you experience are unreal. 

If you don't get what I said above and don't believe in either god or law of nature, and consider yourself scientific, I want you to think about this hypothesis:

Hold any object you have access to in your hand. Let's assume it is a wooden comb. Is the comb real or the wood it is made of real? 

Comb is just a shape, name, and form of the wood. It could be a back scratcher too. Or in the hands of a baby, a toy. 

So let's assume for now the wood is real. Is the wood real or the carbon atoms it is made of real? 

Of course, you are scientific, you know the wood is just a form of organic matter. It is just carbon mostly. 

So are carbon atoms real or the electrons and protons they are made of real? 

Of course, it is the atomic particles you will say. Just change their numbers and configuration, it can become Boron or Nitrogen. 

So are the electrons and protons (or the quarks they are made up of) real? Of course, not. You are so scientific and knowledgable that you know they are disturbances in the Higgs field. 

Mass is an emergent property of elementary particles by the Higgs mechanism through spontaneous symmetry breaking. 

Hmmm, so what is real?

May be only the Higgs field is real. But for it to be real, it has to be experienced by someone or something.

The obersver effect is real in the quantum world. So who's the observer? Let's not call it god as you are very scientific. 

Let's say ""it is some conscious thing coming out of something that science will figure out someday."" 

Great. 

But now think about it. This conscious something is experiencing creation and end of what ultimately emerges as matter (one that has mass and occupies space... Duh, elementary school definition.)

This experiencer of course knows the past states, and that past affects any new emergent stuff. 

Just as in your dream, characters may do stuff based on what you know about them subconsciously. 

It is well established in quantum physics through many peer-reviewed papers in reputed scientific journals you believe in that, both the past state we knoe and, we observing, the ""observer effect"", changes the future state and actions of a particle. 

Can we term this continuity, this interplay of past states shaping future outcome, as ""Karma""? 

Great. You got a sense of what is Karma.

But first, you can bookmark my statement: This kind of racist-supremacist attitude of millions of Chinese sheep, programmed by their firewalled CCP propaganda against India, will bring about their biggest downfall in relative terms in their entire history. And it is going to happen soon.

I have nothing against the Chinese. They are nice people, great culture, but just too ignorant of the world and imagine themselves to be the center of it. 

I can show you a very simple thing that will prove Indian civilizational influence has been the most dominant in the world, not China, for at least 2000 years. 

Just take China's backyard which is South East Asia. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia... all the way to Philippines. The Chinese had direct land access to most of these countries for two thousand years.

Yet what do we find?

Entire SE Asia followed Hinduism and Buddhism (or Islam in the case of Indonesia and Malaysia, which too was sent there by many Indian Muslim traders from West coast of India along with Arabs).

Their scripts be it Thai, Khmer, Lao, Indonesian are Indian scripts. Not Chinese. 

Even today, in some SE Asian countries people get upset if Chinese character boards come up.

None of these SE countries even today take Chinese RMB but will lap up USD. That itself shows how weak China is in its own sphere of influence and trade today!

Their religion and culture are highly Indianized.

Their kingdoms through history built Indian style temples and pagodas. 

Their languages are mainly influenced by Sanskrit and Tamil. From Singapore to Cambodia to Malaysia are versions of Indianized names in Malay, Khmer etc.

Their cuisines are Indianized. Many of their spices and curry are Indian in origin.

Their traditional medicine system like the famous Thai one, including Thai massage are of Indian origin.

In Thailand, go to any good Thai massage place, you will find an Indian rishi statue who they consider and workship as guru of Thai medicine. Go read about Shiva(go) Kumara.

Go as far as Phillipines, you will see influence of Cholas even in their names.

Go to Japan and Korea. Forget Buddhism, even some of their local dieties, are inspired by Indian Hindu gods and Buddhist iconography.

Where was China for all these years? Why they could never even touch their own backyard by land with such dominant influence like India for thousands of years, while India could through vast distances by sea.

Now, in China itself. Many of their gods are of Indian origin clearly. They have Ashoka stupa in Beijing and Xian. They use Indian Hindu numerals and maths.

The Chess they celebrate winning these days, and their own ""traditional"" Chess are from India or Indian inspired. 

Even their badminton which they are so famous for and take pride was started in Tamilnadu under British rule from a local Indian game.

As I said, someone who disrespects their guru in the most disgusting ways will earn very bad karma and will face the consequences. It will happen for China.

And such programmed puppets parrot this mantra without question. You can’t reason with them that the same ecosystem also controls the studies, peer reviews, and publishing process.

During COVID, “prestigious” journals like The Lancet and Nature were caught publishing Big Pharma backed studies on COVID drugs authored by a porn model and a fantasy book writrt. With their usual work dried up, they pivoted to ghostwriting and publishing for big pharma.

Later, these journals had to issue apologies and retract those sham “studies.” (https://t.co/4G3EuCBFCA)

For every study these sheep show around, we can point to another “scientific” study that contradicts it, if it’s backed by an industry with enough cash. Even for Diet Coke, I can literally point to a dozen scientific studies showing anything between ""it is mildly dangerous for health"" to ""it will make you die early.""

Take the candy and confectionery industry. They funded a massive study (over 7,000 men) claiming eating sugar candy three times a week extends lifespan, published in a “prestigious” journal.(https://t.co/6cbcZtgsrv)

So, should we all start chomping candy every other day like kids?

My point: Throwing around claims like “A scientific study showed Diet Coke is healthier than sugarcane juice” is meaningless. Such nonsense makes some doctors look like unscientific sheep to the real scientific community - those who conduct rigorous research and understand the quality of studies. 

True scientists have zero commercial interests and aren’t industry puppets. They know most research is tainted by Big Industry money.

Also, these days, the public isn’t clueless either. We remember when doctors pushed cigarette smoking as “healthy” based on Big Tobacco’s “studies.” 

So, stop embarrassing yourselves and dragging the already shaky reputation of the doctor community through the mud with such ridiculous claims. 

Both Diet Coke and Sugarcane juice won't kill a healthy adult who consumes them in moderation. The key words is ""moderation."" And it varies by individuals.

But stop promoting a product with articifial sweetner like Aspartame (WHO research agency clearly linked it to cancer at higher consumption levels) and other chemicals that disrupt gut microbiome, while putting down your own traditional, natrual drink as something ""dangerous"" because they programmed you to do so.

1946241085853892862,"I’m not sure if a country like India will ever establish a crypto reserve (it should), but I strongly think companies need to set up crypto treasuries.

But I think it is crucial for companies to have at least a portion of their financial reserves in cryptocurrency. 

Because I believe the US itself will allow the physical dollar to crash sometime in the next decade.

The amount of USD printed in recent years, the amount of US debt, and the counterfeit superdollars printed by DPRK and China, which have allowed them to thrive and grow spectacularly (especially China), all indicate that the US may willingly crash the dollar or let adversaries themselves do it.

This is where Bitcoin and Crypto come in. 

I believe crypto is a US project for continued financial dominance because they hold the ‘keys’. China or DPRK can’t print Bitcoin or counterfeit it. The US debt is not denominated in Bitcoin. All countries will eventually have to join the Bitcoin bandwagon. There’s no way to crash, counterfeit, or break it.

The US is the largest player in the cryptocurrency space, and its policies and decisions influence prices. The recent Genius Act stablecoin bill suggests to me that the US plans to use cryptocurrency to manage its economy, controlling inflation while the USD weakens and real payable debt significantly reduces.

If Satoshi is the US, and it already holds 1 million BTC, and if BTC reaches $1 million (which I believe it will), the US will have $1 trillion just like that. Not to mention, they now have a publicly announced cryptocurrency reserve that could potentially hold another million Bitcoins.

And what if the USD were in a free fall? BTC could potentially reach many millions of USD. This would essentially allow the US to clear most of its dollar-denominated debt.

However, what about the long-term value of the USD? 

The USD is not going anywhere. Only the physical USD is getting destroyed. The USD will still be America’s currency and global influence. The USD will re-emerge as the crypto backed dollar, similar to the petro dollar and gold-backed dollar before.

I believe this economic reset is inevitable. Therefore, it makes sense for companies and countries to hold a portion of their currency in major cryptocurrencies, just like the US is doing.

1944959775248351640,"Legendary Sage Yagnavalkya, linked to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (dated 2400-3000 years ago by Western scholars), is said to have composed the Surya Kavacha Stotra. 

In Surya Kavacha Stotra it is advised to take a sun bath facing the sun after a morning shower while reciting the stotra fully. 

It is claimed in the same Stotra that this daily practice frees us from many diseases and keeps us healthy in both mind and the body.

Here’s the verse where it says so:

Susnato yo japetsamyak yo adhite svastha manasah | Sa rogamukto dirghayuh sukham pushtim cha vindati ||

Most of you know sunlight (UVB) helps produce Vitamin D by converting a form of cholesterol in the skin. Vit-D is a hormone vital for bone health, immunity, and more.

But do you know our body utilizes our skin as a large factory, by using sunlight’s energy to synthesize dozens of much more important proteins, hormones, and essential lipids?

Here are just a few I can recall:

Vitamin D (from 7-dehydrocholesterol) - Supports bone health, immune function, and various bodily processes.

Lumisterol - Offers anti inflammatory and antitumor effects.

Cis urocanic acid & Nitric oxide - Lowers blood pressure and reduces inflammation.

Beta Endorphin - Enhances well-being and reduces stress hormones.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone - Regulates stress and suppresses inflammation.

Alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone - Repairs cells, reduces inflammation, and darkens skin (which is a natural sun protection - those outdoors since an young age optimize this balance of sun protection and utilization naturally reducing risk of cancers from harsh sub light).

Some novel lipids like Acylcarnitine and Phosphatidylethanolamine - They signal our immune cells via lymph nodes, boosting our immune response.

Sunlight (a certain portion of UV) also calms an over active immune sysrem giving some relief to autoimmune conditions like Psoriasis and Multiple Sclerosis.

Morning sun light boosts cortisol, dopamine, and norepinephrine, sharpening your mind and improving sleep. 

Now, reciting the Surya Kavacha Stotra while meditating on the sun, facing it in the morning, and doing a body scan relaxes you, refreshes your mind, and times the sun exposure perfectly.

If you’re from a culture blessed with this tradition, embrace it whole heartedly. Ignore the colonized naysayers, ignorant Indians dismissing such things as pseudoscience. 

Instead of fighting our mentally colonized sepoys, I would say thank the Western scientists researching meditation, Surya namaskar, yoga, and Ayurvedic remedies with an open mind - even if they appropriate the proven benefits under their brand names.

Also expressing this gratitude is scientifically proven to enhance mental health and well being. Please thank me too for the post in replies. It is proven by science that receiving gratitude helps well-being :)

But entirely silly to be so rude without even knowing the difference between dietary consumption levels and therapeutic dosing when talking about drugs and herbs.

For example, hundreds of millions of people take Aspirin for pain and inflammation. The only ingredient in it, Salycilic acid, is a natural compound found in many plants and foods.

We all consume tiny amounts of Salycilic acid everyday in food. Yet, it is not going to help cure our headache or arthritis pain. 

But a 350 mg dose of the same Salycilic acid will cure the headache or pain in 30 mins to 1 hour for most of us fit enough to take it.

And at just 80mg, it can help protect against heart attacks and strokes for those at risk. The humble salycilic acid made by plants is a life saver for millions.

It is the same for Turmeric. While Indians do consume Turmeric in good amounts thanks to our culinary tradition shaped by systems like Ayurveda, and while it does seem to offer some benefits to us in population studies for say colon cancer, it is still not theraupetic levels used in some Ayurvedic preparations for inflammatory conditions.

I am not upset at this person or his language. What I am upset is at the number of such colonized young minds in India in 2025.

1944593156202242542,"Dr. Shreenivas, you are calling a scientifically proven substance (Turmeric) in treatment of inflammatory conditions like Psoriasis and Arthritis as pseudoscience because you have been programmed to do so by a system. 

Please don't get me wrong, and bear with my long post, but that's exactly what is happening here.

Though you may feel countered and not agree now, one day you will get old enough to realize how the systems we are part of program our brain to act like chatGPT to utter ""Pseudoscience"" as the next word the moment the word ""Ayurveda"" is registered.

In fact, if you see my original post, I deliberately edited a term from Curcumin to Ayurveda to trigger this reaction from some to get this message across. 

Ayurveda uses Turmeric (with its active ingredient curcumin) for at least two thousand years for inflammatory conditions.

But now there is great modern scientific evidence of curcumin and other compounds in Turmeric working better than not just placebo in the three inflamatory conditions mentioned above, but also currently available pharmaceuticals in some conditions.

These are multiple peer reviewed RCT studies on humans, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of RCTs published in leading journals. 

As a doctor, I am sure, you will be able to go find them if you have an open mind and wish to research further. 

But here is a gist of how Turmeric works: 

Curcumin inhibits matrix proteinases, enzymes that degrade cartilage, thus preserving joint integrity in osteoarthritis.

Curcumin influences pain pathways, potentially by inhibiting substance P and other mediators, leading to reduced pain perception, as measured by tools like the pain visual analouge scale and Womac scores.

Most importantly, Curcumin inhibits inflammation pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa B and COX-2, reducing the production of cytokines like TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6, which are elevated in arthritis (osteo and rheumatoid arthrits).

Ayurvedic practioners recognized these benefits through experience over hundreds of years, intiution, and practise. That is also knowledge. 

Not only that, they figured out adding an ""anupana"" - a medium of transport and delivery - like pepper, enhanced Turmeric effects.

Modern science researching (at UCLA) why Indians add pepper in Haldi milk found Piperine in pepper makes Curcumin bio-available 2000x better. And it is now being used by both Pharaceutical and Neutraceutical companies to enhance curcumin absorbtion.

Understand this: Knowledge is not limited to only modern science. Knowledge creation is not limited to only that comes out rigorous modern scientific research and randomized controlled trials. Humans have produced more knowledge before RCTs even became a thing.

If we keep a very closed mind, let it get programmed by others, and never explore our own traditional knowledge systems, we will forever remains slaves of this modern system and not become a masters of it.

Someone told me ""TCM is scientific, not like Ayurveda"" in their programmed ignorance forgetting TCM is just like Ayurveda from China. 

But the difference is, the Chinese, who do not have colonized minds like us Indians, are taking their knowledge system with an open mind and getting it passed through modern scientific system. That is research -> publish -> peer review -> prove to world it works.

If we sit with a closed mind that ""Ayurveda is Pseudoscience"" then we will never be able to benefit from and advance a vast amount of traditional knowledge our ancestors have gathered over centuries. Instead we will forever remain slaves of other systems.

It won't be long before the Chinese come sell us our own Turmeric based treatments for inflamatory conditions and Ayurvedic Andropgraphis as an antibiotic as scientific treatments backed by their published research.

We will use that too claiming ""but sir, that is scientific"" as told to us, while doing no science ourselves with our own enormous amount of existing traditional knowledge.",https://x.com/aravind/status/1944593156202242542,tweet,Aravind,@aravind,99,32,785,3150,186541,390,2025-07-14 08:31:51,,

No. Don't be rude. Don't impose yourself. Don't be ignorant-arrogant to make other Indians and the world hate you. Learn and appreciate all Indian languages. Preserve their sounds.

But, unlike the Chinese, many Indian sepoy minds will start shouting ""Ayurveda is pseudoscience."" the moment you talk about it.

Then how to even consider it for research with RCTs? When the same people who are supposed to be taking it up for research are programmed to reject it as snake oil without any scientific temparament?

It is so sad to see so many Indians easily programmed and influenced by foreign propaganda and just parrot whatever is said to them. ""TCM is well researched Sir, Ayurveda is not.""

What a joke. Shame. 

These posts by Indians putting TCM, a medicinal system in many ways inspired from Ayurveda too, ahead of Ayurveda, as ""scientific"" citing one or two research while ignoring all the research in our own Ayurveda, that has shown many of its drugs effective, just proves how colonized their minds are without them realizing it.

Simple answer is: This is a logical deduction. Not a big deal to predict, imho.

This was my thinking:

If the F-35 is supposedly ""not being able to be fixed"" for so long, they will have to take it back sooner than later. RAF C-17 is the best way. 

Loading it onto some truck and moving it to a port in Indian traffic for loading it back on their Aircraft carrier is complicated, risky, and not practical.

RAF C-17s are stationed in Oxfordshire base mostly. So I added that. Though it may come from some RAF middle-east or nearby base within its range too.

Even now, this C-17 taking it back is just a ""likely"" scenario. 

May be it will magically get fixed and fly away now that the psyops on behalf of the red-geeen cabal running the UK (China-Pak, my conspiracy) has been done. 

We will see. 

Though I am grateful for many of you appreciating me for ""prediction"",  ""intiution"", ""having intel"", etc, I have to say anyone can do this sort of simple deductive reasoning.

Just be open to all possiblities first. Take in all information filling your gaps. Next consider the most simple scenarios - it is the most likely to happen in the future.

Imagine something you try to break. You hit it hard. You hit it harder. Again and again. It doesn't break. But it absorbs. It adapts. It becomes stronger. 

That is India.

The world has tried everything on it. 

Wars imposed. Islamization. Colonization. Subjugation. Exploitation. Genocide. Cultural imposition. Spiritual erosion. Terrorism. Infiltration. Demographic change. Division. Civilizational destruction.

India takes it all and survives. Even when other civilizations around it crumble or corrupt into something else. 

That is India's resilience. A hard earned resilience over many millenia. It comes not from its rulers, governments, or borders but from its culture.

This resilient culture is the core of its civilizational identity. A culture that subconsciously understands the highest human philosophy - the impermenance of all and the illusion of existence.

You can disrupt but can't defeat such a civilization. Adversaries now understand this. And from the west to the east they are trying to break the civilizational identity and bond of Indians.

They use media and algorithms to program communities and ethnicities of this diverse civilization to feel different, and not Indian. They exploit the apathy of India's administration to poison our minds.

It took a thousand years for Islamic invaders to break us into two. But it may take just 100 years for Infowar invaders to break us into many. It is the ""law of accelerating returns of the invaders.""

This post is a wake up call to those in power. Do not take India's civilizational strength for granted. Be a part of it. Do something about the infowar imposed on India and do it now. 

They are hitting us again and again. Enough has been absorbed. Now let's act. Let's adapt. Make ourselves stronger. And be our own civilizational strength.

A substantial majority of them are likely to lose their jobs within the next decade.

Their knowledge, support, and attitude are significantly lacking compared to their Western or even Philippine counterparts.

They struggle to answer simple queries and handle minor issues. Moreover, their attitude sucks when questioned, and they literally get to ego-fueled arguments and fights with the customer.

I can tell you with 100% certainty that Artificial Intelligence is poised to replace human agents.

Both myself and most foreign clients would be more than willing to interact with an AI rather than endure such ignorance with arrogance.

These issues are particularly prevalent in Indian call centers compared to US or other Asian counterparts. There’s a complete lack of respect for customers and, it seems, their own jobs.

Based solely on customer feedback and advancements in AI voice models, I’m certain that companies will rapidly replace these incompetent individuals with AI in the coming years.

I believe the government must be prepared for this. These arrogant and unemployed youth are sure to flood the streets with their entitlement and cause chaos.

This is one of the ways we grow the economy. Take already popular products and improve them. Continuous innovation and improvememt is key. 

The Japanese have a term for it: Kaizen.

If it were the Japanese and they had inherited a culture as rich as India, by now we will be seeing Rasagulla and Gulab Jamun individually and intricately wrapped, adapted to an international pallete by reducing sugar and improving texture, and sold for $10 a piece. 

In India, the culture seems to be to inflate prices unreasonably without any improvement. The companies extract until the last penny which can be extracted from the customer.

I am sure, in two decades, these Little Hearts will be sold for Rs. 50 a packet with no improvements, and worse, cheaper ingredients. It is already being sold for double that 50-rupee price in North America.

In India, be it health care, education, real estate, or restaurants, there is no improvement in quality, or worse, it is going down but prices are being jacked up at a premium over nominal inflation. This has to be arrested and reversed.

There's a method to it and there's science. What Pakistanis and Chinese are doing is this sort of social engineering within India to break India easily using just information warfare. 

They are using critical theory methods and advanced targetted psyops using tech to target groups and program them.

I have seen some people get very triggered and upset when I point out ""there are many accounts that are not Indian"" creating hate and divide."" They retort ""No! They are all Indian. See this guy is Indian, that one is really Indian."" 

Yes, there will always be viciously hateful people within every community. It is natural in every society. But they are NOT the only reason there's so much of hate and animosity between groups in India.

They are only used as useful pawns in an organized hate and divide operation that is affecting everyone's mental health. Foriegn actors fuel hate and incite these types. They in turn incite more. It is a very simple crowd psychology they are using.

Even the triggered and upset behavior of some when I point out an outside hand is due to such foreign run operations. As these people are now 100% programmed and certain it is really that group hating them. So anything said contrary to their programmed assumptions triggers them.

In my opinion, this could have been a message:

""India appreciates President Trump’s intervention on behalf of Pakistan, giving them a face-saver and helping them take the off-ramp offered by India many times.

At the Trump Administration’s request, India's DGMO picked up the call from our Pakistani counterpart requesting a ceasefire.

Prime Minister Modi admires his great friend President Trump for his peace efforts and decided to suspend punitive action on Pakistan, which has left them devastated and weakened. 

India has decisively met its military objectives in decimating Pakistan’s terror infrastructure. Operation Sindoor is suspended as of now, as decided by India.

However, Pakistan would be wise to be forewarned that any border provocation, terrorism, or activity by it that undermines India’s sovereignty will be seen as an act of war. 

In such a case, India reserves the right to retaliate militarily and disproportionately.""

It is simple. Iran broadcast much before that they are going to do this missile attack. Now declared they sent exactly the same number of missiles as US bombs. And they said they sent it explicitly towards US bases and not Qatar. The missiles were all simple ballistic missiles that were all taken down.

All this points to de-escalation on part of Iran. So markets are reacting well like peace is coming. That's how we read this.

But the US, and especially Israel, will they take the deal and stop? Or use this to go in for a regime change? How do we know this is not a bluff by Iran like the Trump bluffed of peace?

If not, India must confiscate the Air India brandname from TATA. Let them call it Tata Airlines, Vistara, or whatever.

------

I am still wondering why India needs to let our companies employ foreign CEOs in critical sectors? I am not against private sector's freedom or having foreign CEOs per se. Many Indian nationals head foreign companies successfully. 

But India's aviation sector is strategic and critical to the economy. And by now, even the deep state deniers I know have started to acknowledge at least some attempt by adversaries, if not the DS, to derail India's economy hitting these sectors.

Given these circumstances, it is imperative for India to ensure TATA and Indigo employ patriotic Indians as CEOs. 

Better still if it can be mandated to have retired top level Air Force officers on the board of Indian airline companies to monitor anti-national activity.

Why this airline duopoly in India are employing foreign CEOs when India's aviation sector is so many decades old? And when there's a good deal of Indian CEO talent available? 

What is their compulsion? Is it some global force that says they can access foreign airports and routes only if they employ these foreign CEOs?

My suggestions may sound draconian on private sector freedoms, but this CCP level control is what India needs now over many of our critical companies.

Or I can assure you many of them will be sabotaged, harassed, economically forced, and arm-twisted by the deep state to become their pawns, even if they really don't want to.

So I asked them casually if the Chinese and Indian food were always good? 

They said, ""No, they are the worst. Last time I even found hair in my food. But they do not even pick up the phone. They are so rude! Once they picked up the phone and hung-up on me after I complained.""

Yet, what do they get? Constant complaints, criticism, and harassment over everything. 

Why? Because they are like the Dominos and McDs facing CATCH-22. Only when you care, provide good service, and take your customers or, in this case, citizens seriously, you will get too many complaints and criticism. 

When you behave like the Chinese take-away or the hole-in-the-wall Indian, providing worst service, and not caring about any grievance, the public will just shut up and accept it as normal taking the crap you give.

Here's a 'conspiracy theory', but consider it:

I have said many times that the Pahalgam terror attack on Apr 22 had a bigger hand behind than just Pakistan alone. 

While I had strongly leaned towards a Chinese hand, I am now more and more thinking if it was a US orchestrated one using Pak, as many of you have commented before under my posts.

Think about this: Some elements of the USDS who, of course, work with Pakistan (ISI which is very pro US) orchestrate the attack knowing well India will retaliate.

They want India to retaliate and advise the Trump admin to encourage it. They are doing it so as to weaken Pak Army and make it come to the US ditching China.

Once India retaliates and enough damage to Pak has been done, and Pak army is desperate, the US interferes. Asking Pak to offer India a ceasefire and promises. 

But now Pak army has to agree to get back into the US camp. Which is what I think is now happening as today Asim Munir is meeting Trump.

The Pak army which had become a puppet of China and was buying 90% of its weapons from China is now dining with the US and may be working for it against Iran.

This is a big loss for China. 

Today, during the lunch, Trump will offer Pak weapons, ask it to stop buying Chinese weapons, disrupt CPEC, suspend Gwadar, and help the US invade Iran if need be including by supplying pak troops!

Prostituting Pak army will readily agree and get back into the US camp ditching China. Let's see what happens today. If US - Pak announce any weapons or military deal, then this is most likely.

Now, if the above is true, the US may be doing the same to Iran using Israel. Weakening Iran using Israel to attack it. And once weakened enough, hoping for Iran to cut a deal with the US and come into its camp ditching China, Russia, India.

May happen as well, who knows. But my hunch has been strongly that Iran being a strong headed proud regime won't capitulate like Pak and will fight until regime changed.

But we have to understand a few things here:

China is run by a single party with an army like top down chain of command. 

The top does corruption, the bottom does more corruption. They treat it as just a part of China's culture and development.

But the corruption is tolerated only when the set objectives by the top are met by the bottom.

The top says develop this city to Sweden or Singapore standards by this time, the local administration has to get it done.

If they falter, they are purged using the same corruption as an excuse. This can never be done in India.

Even the president of India has no power over a local contractor who doesn't deliver and is corrupt. Everything goes through an independent legal system.

The development in China took a lot of money. They borrowed a lot for that. Like drowned themselves in toxic debt thinking future growth can repay it.

But that comes with a lot of risk. India has not gone down the path. All the developed cities in China are sitting on billions of dollars in debt and interest payments.

When their economy starts tanking, as it looks like now, all these cities will be hit hard. China has risked a lot to do this development. When things start going bad, per capita can half in a short time. 

China's development was also done focussed on cities. Because they can as a single party rule. This is not possible in India.

Though it has become a fashion to compare China with India, there are huge differences in governance, politics, and systems.

Whenever India does something top down under a chain of command, India does it extremely well. For example, depts under PMO like space, drdo etc or what is accomplised by our armed forces.

While India definitely has to do a lot in fixing its cities with better roads and footpaths to look and liveable like international cities, it can only make us look developed (like China fakes).

India can always appreciate what China did. And aspire to develop infra to international standards.  But it must do so by implementing some chain of command authoritarian systems for each project.

Delhi metro is a good example. We can do this for all urban development projects. And I think we are already doing so in many.

An Air India - Ahmedabad - AAI - Adani - Modi hitjob. Get prepared.

Here's what we can expect:

The crash investigation report will come out. It may say ""Fuel contamimation.""

And who contaminated the fuel? Of course, a sabotauer. May be some Paki in London putting a pellet with the right contaminant which is timed correctly, like an extended release capsule, to open and contaminate the tank when the air craft is in Ahmedabad.

But what will be the narrative?

Either Pakistan run Reuters or China run Bloomberg will soon come with a report that Airports Authority of India, Ahmedabad Airport, and Adani Aviation is to blame.

Other DS media like CNA, F24, DW, NYT, AJ all will amplify this, may be even before investigation report is out.

You see the deep state attacks when it can get many birds with one stone. The Red-Green deep state is highly aggrieved. And Pak wants to desperately get back at India but it can't hit us militarily, or even using terror now.

But by doing this crash, even though Air India is private now, we have:

- Gujarat, Ahmedabad, Adani, AAI, GoI, Modi all to be blamed by the DS cabal. 

- Air India, Indian aviation, and image of India can be hit. Causing long term economic loss.

- Many Indians killed, which the murderous hateful perverts across our borders want to do.

- And use all this to churn internal politics and destabilize the country.

I got this strong hunch just now tonight after seeing the DS plant ""aviation expert"", the dressed up performer, change his narrative to ""double engine failure"" after hitting Indian pilots and aviation.

He has clearly been told to change stance now by those who know exactly what happened. His level of details is now suddenly so good as if he has already read the crash report. A few others have also started pushing this at the same time. 

And many DS news achors in India also publicizing the same change in stance suddenly knowing well what is coming and what they need to do to prepare ground work for hitting Adani, Modi, GoI.

All this is a great give away of what is coming I believe. Be prepared and ensure they don't get away with the fake narrative after having caused this horrendous criminal crash with a sabotage. 

The report will indeed tell the truth. But a fuel contamination doesnt mean India, Indian Govt, and Indian companies are to blame suddenly. They have been doing this for a century.

No matter what is in the report, I trust my intitution and I believe it was a sabotage either inside India or most probably when the plane was last outside India.

Let me explain:

Pakistan can never do any nuclear strike on its own. Its nukes are American nukes. Its nukes were given and controlled by the US to keep India, Iran, China, USSR in check long back. 

1998 tests so soon after India also proves that they had nukes already kept and the US just helped Pak test them. 

Pakistan's nuclear blackmail has always been a US tool to control geopolitics in the region. That is to keep India in check.

So what does the US want now? 

Having used Israel to hit and weaken Iran, take out its hardline negotiators and nuclear scientists, buy time by delaying its nuke enrichment program, the US will want to again sit at the table with Iran to do a deal with the same regime.

Remember this regime was brought by the US in 1970s toppling a democracy in Iran.

Also, by using Pak now to blackmail Israel and force it to stop the war and do a deal with Iran, Trump will claim he brought peace to middle for his nobel prize.

“...People still talk about the crew being at fault, but I don’t understand why?”

It's simple. Just two reasons:

1) Boeing’s PR lobby immediately started blaming the crew, as they always do, and shaping the narrative among the general public that it wasn’t Boeing Air Craft issues. So many 'experts' descended on TV shows invited by DS anchors world wide to shape the narrative. It happened in India too, we know the anchors. Boeing sponsored YT channels too immediately peddled this 'pilot error' narrative.

2) There’s a big anti-India Red-Green cabal on social media, primarily run by racist Chinese and radical Islamists, that constantly attacks India and Indians whenever they get the chance shaping world's opinion on India. Their goal is to damage India’s economy and make the world hate India.

That’s it. As simple as that. There’s no confusion.

The Boeing PR lobby, employing its own officials, YouTubers, “experts,” and media outlets, swiftly blamed the captain for the incident.

The India-hating racists around Asia and the world, indoctrinated by a China & Pak operation on a daily basis to harbor animosity towards India, joined the chorus on social media, blaming Indian pilots and training.

Even so-called mainstream “journalists” on DS payroll provided television time to so-called “experts” or propagandists who perpetuated the same narrative, attributing the crash to pilot error. They made it look like it was the truth.

A few days later, the flight data recorder was recovered from the sea. An investigation conducted by US authorities revealed that the MCAS system of the flight was malfunctioning. 

The plane did not crash due to pilot or captain error.

The news of this investigation result, which emerged quite some time after the crash, received limited coverage in the media. The investigation’s findings were largely ignored by SM and media.

However, the anti-India cabal persisted in portraying the incident as “Indian software"" causing the crash using SM account farms and influencers. 

While it is true that Boeing develops software in India, it does not mean that such critical software is simply shipped into planes without extensive testing and clearance from American engineers at Boeing in the US.

My point is, this is how they all operate against India, even for a foreign airline flight involving a foreign-made aircraft going down given the chance.

Indians who are swayed by such operations on SM/M should be cautious.

1931721236305805351,"China has already colonized Cambodia. And using SM influence operations over a decade, has programmed hate between Thais and Khmers. 

It is not unlike what it did between Maldives and India or Bangladesh and India. This is why India has to take SM propaganda seriously and not be so apathetic. 

Now Thailand and Cambodia have revived old border issues. It was inevitable. When you create so much virtual hate wars between people it will turn into kinetic at some point in time.

Thailand, which is an ally of the US, and which is not allowing China to construct a canal bypassing Malacca or a railway through it, will be drawn into a war with Cambodia. 

And China will arm Cambodia to fight this war to arm twist thailand and weaken it They wanted to do this to India using Bangladesh with the help of USDS they run these days. They are still trying. 

They are now spreading hate between Indians and Bhutanese / Nepalese the exact same way they seeded hate using fake accounts between Thai and Khmer. Hope India takes this seriously. 

Maldives and Bangladesh must be a lesson for India. It is easy to say we do not care they hate us. But why they need to hate us due to foreign hate propaganda on India? Why should we as a power allow it?

An entire generation has been programmed to hate India in some neighboring countries. These are the ones who will form the govt and armed forces in decades to come. 

Even Filipinos and Indonesians are being programmed to hate Indians. We are selling them Brahmos. Imagine the consequences one day in the future.

And not only that, India seems so apathetic we are allowing them to program our own people to hate each other. One community vs another. One caste vs another. One ethnicity vs another. One religion vs another. Even one region vs another.

All by seeding hate and making use of existing divides and incidents by fake accounts acting as one community or another. Then making the hate and divisiveness become organic. This is the modus operandi.

The communists using their new critical theory methods are having a field day in India making large communities hostile to the state and others. To create civil war. Due to apathy of the state.

This is where India will end up if we keep sleeping over SM hate and divisiveness using fake account farms.

India is a nuclear power. It is a missile and anti-missile/drone superpower. It is not an expansionist power and its military is entirely for its defence.

In such a case, no counrtry will dare touch us, no matter how much power differential they gain, as long as we set our rules and red lines preemptively without being reactive as always.

Only when we behave like a reactive small power limiting ourselves in military operations and retaliation, we let such new tech become a threat. 

In fact, even a silly plane like J-10 and mundane tech like social media becomes a threat with the passive and self-limitimg defence posturing India adopts. 

Nobody cares about India, so India doesn't need to care about what anyone else thinks or says. This India's care for what the world thinks has been a weakness in my opinion.

India needs to start acting like a nuclear, missile, army, and naval superpower it is in the region. And set clear rules for engagement and escalation based on the adversary's potential. 

In this endeavour, even constantly crying about threats and adversaries' 4th and 5th gen warfare should also part of the toolkit. It must be done constantly. 

Even an hyperpower like the US cries about these things like cyber threats and biowar for its preemptive potential, and in programming the population to become prepared. 

India should stop acting like ""we have everything under control, this or that threat doesn't exist."" All kinds of genocidal threats exists for India. The hate for India is the highest in our history today.

The recent world captials tour by Indian delegation crying about Pak's terrorism, and India setting clear red lines regarding Pak's terror is a good start. 

Next, we need to look at using our nuke deterrent the best way by modifying policies and bringing a lot of ambiguity. 

And most importantly, with regards to China, it must be made clear that next time in case of any misadventure at the LAC, that leads to even a small loss of a territory or personnel, it may lead to a very large scale escalation by India.

And China will have to fight a full scale war with India weakening itself considerably even if it lasts just a week. India must make it clear its terriorial integrity and soverignity will be defended to death, devastating China in the process.

IMHO, these sort of red lines and strong policies, with further stockpiling of missiles and strengthening of air defence power will keep India safe for the next war prone decade.

At the same time, India must bring next gen aircraft / defence tech development directly under the PMO (letting the Dept of Space go to some ministry if need be).

Regrettably, this deplorable behavior is permitted unchecked on social media platforms due to either indifference or a lack of effective action by relevant ministries and officials within India. Let me say it again - this is happening due to the ineptitude and apathy of our officials.

This orchestrated campaign, spearheaded by a Sino-Pakistani nexus, leverages thousands of social media accounts to disseminate hateful commentary on Indians and actively shape negative perception of India across the world.

While I am uncertain about the long-term implications of this gambling culture driven, ad-hoc Chinese strategy, it is now undeniable that spending on so-called luxury brands is a silly endeavor.

Luxury goods market disruption:

Beyond a certain point, money can no longer purchase quality goods. People are only seeking status with brands, leading them to spend irrational amounts of money.

However, these same individuals now appear as losers to society as China demonstrates that a Rolex is “Made in China” for less than $1000, while a LV bag costs less than $100 to produce.

This campaign will have a huge impact on people's preferences and the world's luxury goods market, I'm sure.

Geopolitical implications:

China, leveraging its immense social media and media influence, is urging people to directly purchase Chinese replicas of luxury Western products as part of its ongoing trade war.

This strategy not only benefits Chinese factories by increasing their profits during challenging trade conditions but also exerts pressure on EU countries to refrain from aligning with the US. 

China is communicating its ability to disrupt EU's primary sources of income in exporting luxury goods.

Although this strategy may yield short-term advantages, it is likely to fail in the long run, as is often the case with many Chinese actions. 

China lacks the creative innovation spirit of countries to its west. It remains a copycat nation even today, as it has been for centuries.

While European countries may initially side with China fearing losses, their companies will eventually move away their manufacturing operations from China in the long term. 

And despite a temporary disruption in public's luxury preferences due to this Chinese campaign, people will continue to pay exorbitant prices for so-called luxury goods, as it is driven by human nature.

However, China will be unable to participate much in this luxury goods economy in the future as the world understands the risks associated with manufacturing brands in China.

China exposed:

While China, along with Pakistan, are spending considerable money in making the world believe ""India is a scam capital"", it is China which is the world's biggest scam capital. 

From faking luxury goods to cloning all western tech to stealing intellectual property, China has been eroding billions in profits to western countries. 

Not to mention scam-call centers on an industrial scale operated in countries like Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia etc by the Chinese scamming the world of billions - an official way China makes money as its economy tanks.

Despite what the CCP supremacists claim, the truth is that Pakistan is owned by India. Therefore, whatever China builds there is also owned by India.

Consider the Gwadar port, for instance. 

Tens of billions of dollars have been sunk and wasted by China. The only cargo that arrives there is cargo to rebuild infrastructure of CPEC that has been blasted by militants in Balochistan which Pakistan falsely blames India for. So sad.

On the other hand, the Chabbar port just 70 kms west, backed by India, is a significant success. It handles over tens of thousands of tonnes of cargo every year. Despite US sanctions, it is fully functional and used by India. No issues.

Indians should understand the distinction between paper power and real power. We should not be swayed by propaganda on paper and glitzy show, which the CCP Chinese are very adept at.

Operation Sindoor has demonstrated that India can own Pakistan at will, and China can't use them as a proxy to box us in. The illusion China had that they can use a nuclear dog to threaten us and fight us is shattered.

This has significantly weakened China and exposed its weakness in the region, not to mention its defense equipment that were made into sitting duck target practice by India.

So it is natural, the CCP Chinese will jump up and down to accuse, mock, and belittle India in their racist-supremacist ways for some time due to the derangement they are going through.

We should take it easy. China has become a stupid supremacist country under the CCP, losing its culture and humility. Whenever you see Chinese comments mocking India, patronizingly point out their losses in Pakistan.

Now, many in the Chinese diaspora worldwide too are changing this way due to Tiktok Chinese supremacist propagana.

However, let me assure you that this fascist, racist, and supremacist hubris will be shattered within this decade. The collapse of the CCP and the immense suffering its racially radicalized Chinese citizens will endure as karma will be bad.

The loss of face for China as its hidden crimes, poverty, and corruption are exposed when the Great Firewall falls will be devastating for all Chinese for generations to come.

Until then, it is crucial to understand the CCP-Chinese culture:

- They exhibit the worst forms of racism, fascist-supremacist behavior towards other Asians and Africans, yet a slave mentality towards the West, adopting Western names, style of marriage, Christianity, and even worshipping white men.

- They engage in a rape culture, kidnapping and abducting women from Pakistan, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and other countries to keep as sex slaves in the name of marriage. 

- The ironic aspect of CCP-Chinese culture is that whatever they accuse India or others of is precisely what they are doing or being. 

- Therefore, whenever you see China accusing India or the US of doing something or being something, you can confidently say that they are doing or being that.

- The core of CCP-Chinese' mocking, patronizing, and supremacist culture towards India stems from an India complex. 

- Despite their attempts to deny it, this complex may be rooted in the 2,000 years of Indian cultural dominance and their own cultural revolution.

- This India complex manifests in their obsession with Indian color, toilets, feces, trains, dirt, poverty, and caste. In contrast, most Indians are oblivious to the significant events and cultural developments happening in China.

- The India complex deepens whenever they sense India is prevailing against their wishes. Be in Doklam in 2017, or Galwan in 2020, or Pakistan in 2025.

But I believe it’s important. Hope it is shared widely so that it reaches @PMOIndia, @HMOIndia, @MIB_India 

-----

Operation Sindoor has united all of India beyond politics, religion, caste, or region. This unity must be preserved and built on.

While politics may erupt, and rightly so in a democracy, we all can agree that foreign entities should not interfere in our country and sow seeds of discord.

However, this is happening till date and there seems to be an national apathy towards fixing the issues in India's SM, OTT, & media landscape.

It is my humble request to the MIB to start acting now. And take concrete steps to cleanse Indian social media and media from foreign interference, toxic content, hate, and divisiveness.

Here are the important issues:

1) Foreign influence ops

We all SM users have been aware of fake “account farms” operated by Pakistan, China, Turkey, and other countries for many years now. They are:

- using fake indian named accounts
- planting discord among Indians
- inciting communal, regional, & caste hate
- interfering in our politics
- spreading hate against Indians in the world
- making our neighbors hate us
- dehumanizing and delegitimizing Indians
- spreading fake news on India
- hooking our youth to perverted content
- radicalizing young Indians in ideology

Many issues we observe online, that turn into self-blame and internal strife, escalating into actual street conflicts and protests, are being deliberately seeded by fake account farms.

They operate under various false identities, such as INC supporters, RSS workers, Biharis, Tamils, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Dalits, Brahmins, Sikhs, etc

They’re deliberately sowing seeds of hatred and division in India. It’s natural for people to take sides when an issue is raised, and this will attract more people into the hate and fight spiral, which will appear organic.

We must act immediately against this grave threat to our country.

However, we must avoid reacting impulsively. For example, suddenly sending a list of accounts to be banned to an SMP.

This national security threat demands a systematic approach. Not knee-jerk reactions because the PMO or HMO took notice. Issuing a list of account bans now and then won’t solve the problem.

2) SM companies acting with impunity

SM platforms are not taking action against blatantly racist, dehumanizing, and genocidal hate against Indians.

Even when we report posts from accounts that literally have names like “Kill all Pajeets” posting content like “Indians are cockroaches who all need to be terminated,” we get a “we found no violation” response.

How is this allowed? Isn't it a shame for a $4 trillion power? We really need to hold SM companies accountable.

As the first step, create an independent reporting mechanism for SM, OTT, and media content for citizens to use easily. Europe uses such a system which companies need to provide for every post, content, and media article.

Now, based on crowd-sourced reports, once a content is deemed dangerous, establish a automated system to ensure companies promptly comply with GoI notices.

Use their own definitions of content violations and their own system of strikes, suspensions, and bans. First, clearly outline the red lines and the associated fines.

For example, we can implement a policy that throttles access to SM platforms by our ISPs in case punitive action is needed, instead of outright banning them.

This system should slow down their access speeds, incurring significant financial losses for them until they take action or face a temporary ban.

3) Foreign content in Indian media:

Many vernacular media, and even national media, seem to be funded by foreign entities carrying their news, content, and propaganda quite blatantly. 

Also, in the name of debate shows and free speech by ""guests"", some channels are blatantly promoting anti-India and enemy propaganda even during a time like war.

Operation Sindoor presents an opportunity and the right time to end this. Identify these media by analyzing their content. And end it.

Please set up a media monitoring cell if it doesn’t exist. AI monitoring sounds cool and can be done at leisure. For now we just need an old-school media and SM monitoring center covering all regions & languages.

4) Vulgarity and obscenity exploding on SM:

Perverse and vulgar content is being widely circulated on SM and OTT services in India. In recent years, OTT platforms and production houses have sprung up literally for just making soft porn. 

Incest, perversion, sexual aggression, infidelity, and voyeurism are all being normalized.

How can India, as a civilization, culture, and nation allow this? We must take immediate action to address the pervasive issue of such content corrupting our youth. We cannot afford to let it pass.

This is unacceptable, whether domestically or internationally, narratives matter. Ultimately, whatever happens in the world is a direct consequence of what people believe.

Public opinion shapes the policies of most countries. These include big powers like US, UK, all of Europe, Japan, and even non-democratic Arab states.

Imagine this: if the Trump base is being, without any counter from India, programmed to hate Indians and India by the CCP-PAK, this will certainly manifest in Trump’s policies towards India.

It’s a no-brainer.

Similarly, if India doesn’t even take as much action as a bankrupt Pakistan to influence the global narrative about India, with even small countries’ official media attacking India daily, it is our own failure isn't it?

This is resulting in tangible and intangible losses in billions of dollars every year. Not to mention, it threatens the safety and well-being of our citizens.

Even India’s security is weakened. If the world perceives us as a dirty and dangerous country that deserves no sympathy, then they won't care if we get nuked or wiped out by a biowar.

The threat to us is really getting that serious nowadays due to our inaction in countering an orchestrated hate campaign against India and no-effort in pushing our narrative.

The above statement on our ineffectiveness can be easily proven by the narratives surrounding the recent India-Pak conflict. No denial will help.

1921965211805704192,"My opinion: India must openly talk about these daily drone intrutions and firing by Pak we are hearing. No need to brush it under the carpet thinking it is small or it will stop. Anyway, people in India hear about it. No need to imagine what the world thinks doesn't matter. The world should know what India is facing. Without official emphatic narrative with warnings, even the one or two media that pick up these and post won't. If India takes action, it will be dubbed aggression very quickly by many countries to hit us and trouble us. I really can't understand this silence in building a narrative that suits us. Broken Windows Theory - do not let small transgressions go unanswered. The least we can do is complain about it.
