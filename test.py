    Extract predictions about future events from the text.

    A prediction is a statement about what will happen, might happen, or is expected to happen in the future.

    Rules:
    - Only extract actual predictions, not opinions about past/present events
    - Use exact text from the source for extraction_text
    - Set yearMade to the current year (2025) unless specified otherwise
    - Set yearExpected to the year when the predicted event should occur
    - Set measurable to True if the prediction can be objectively verified
    - Set certainty to True if the prediction is stated with confidence, False if speculative
    - Set confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on how likely this is to be a genuine prediction
    - Categorize domain: technology, politics, economics, social, war, sports, climate, etc.
    - Include any reasoning/justification provided for the prediction
    - If no predictions are found, return empty extractions list
